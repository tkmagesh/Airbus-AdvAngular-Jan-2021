Template Driven Form (TDF) AND Reactive Forms

TDF
    form logic in the component template
    dynamic forms is difficult to achieve
    custom validation is difficult to implement
    unit testing is not possible, only e2e testing is possible

visited - ng-untouched, ng-touched
changed - ng-pristine, ng-dirty
valid - ng-invalid, ng-valid  

Reactive Form
    Form is driven by the model
    FormBuilder


Data Server
from the folder that has the db.json file, run the following command
    npx json-server db.json -p 4000


Async Operation
    Initiated but not waited for its completion (Non Blocking)

    1. callback
    2. EventEmitter
    3. Promise
    4. Async Await
    5. generator
    6. Observable

Observable X Enumerable
    Iterator + Lazy evaluation



let nos = [3,1,4,2,5]
for(let index = 0, count = nos.length; index < count; index++){
    let no = nos[index];
}

class NoIterator{
    _index = 0;
    _count = 0;
    _list;

    constructor(list){
        this._list = list;
        this._index = 0;
        this._count = _list.length;
    }

    next(){
        ++this._index;
        if (this._index < this._count){
            return this._list[this._index]
        } else {

        }
    }
}

function getEvenNumbers(nos){
    var noIterator = new NoIterator(nos)
    var result = [];
    while(let no = noIterator.next()){
        if (no % 2 === 0){
            result.push(no);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

Event Driven Applications

employees.dat
id, name, salary, doj, dob

Avg salary of the employees

    var total = 0,
        count = 0;
    open file
    while (!eof){
        line = read line
        sal = parse line
        total += sal
        ++count;
    }
    avg = total / count
    close file
    return avg

promise - singular response
Observable - stream of events

Source of async
    UI Events (keyboard, mouse) - stream
    timer events - stream
    Ajax requests (singular)
    Server Sent Events (SSE) - stream
    Web Sockets - stream
    Dom Updates
    
rxjs
    Observable, operators

DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)
    Dependencies SHOULD NOT BE created and used at the same place


OCP (Open Closed Principle)
    Open for extension and Closed for modification


class A{
    constructor(B b){

    }
    m1(){
        b.doSomething()
    }
}

Class B{
    constructor(C c){

    }
}

class D{
    constructor(e E){

    }
}

A a = new A(new B(new C(new D(new E))));
Dependency Injector

DI.get(typeof A)
